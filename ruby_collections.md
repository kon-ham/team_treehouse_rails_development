- Set a variable called last_item which uses the pop method to take the last item out of the grocery_list array.

    ```
    grocery_list = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "ice cream", "carrots", "potatoes"]

    last_item = grocery_list.pop
    ```

- Set a variable called first_item which uses the shift method to take the first item out of the grocery_list array.

    ```
    grocery_list = ["milk", "eggs", "bread", "ice cream", "carrots", "potatoes"]

    last_item = grocery_list.pop

    first_item = grocery_list.shift
    ```

- Create a variable called grocery_item_1 which is a new hash.

    `grocery_item_1 = Hash.new`
